Possible Risks of Bank of America’s Missing Money Strategy Bank of America has recently adopted a new strategy for handling accounts with missing funds. While this strategy promises to make the process easier for consumers, there are some risks that they need to be aware of. Firstly, the new strategy does not require Bank of America to inform customers that their account is missing funds.

This could result in a dwindling of their savings if they do not take steps to ensure the account remains active.\nFinally, Bank of America has a legal obligation to report any dormant accounts to the Internal Revenue Service, which could result in the account holder being required to pay taxes on any money in the account. As such, it is important for consumers to weigh the potential benefits of using the service with the risks before they decide to use the Bank of America’s Missing Money Strategy.\nUltimately, the Bank of America’s Missing Money Strategy could be a great way for consumers to get more out of their account, but they must be aware of the potential risks before taking the plunge.\nII.
