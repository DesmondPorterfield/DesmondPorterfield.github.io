Adhering to the Anti-Inflammatory Diet for Psoriasis Relief<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#iii-adhering-to-the-anti-inflammatory-diet-for-psoriasis-relief-1>#</a></h3><p>The anti-inflammatory diet is a great choice for those suffering from psoriasis. Eating a balanced, plant-based diet full of vitamin-rich vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats can help reduce psoriasis flare-ups. Additionally, it is beneficial to limit or avoid processed and fried foods, added sugar, red meat, and dairy as they can be sources of inflammation.</p><p>Some recommended foods to incorporate into an anti-inflammatory diet are fatty fish like salmon, walnuts, spinach, blueberries, and turmeric. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish, are known to reduce inflammation and redness. Walnuts are also a great source of omega-3s, as well as other essential minerals. Spinach and other dark leafy greens are packed with vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, C, E, and K. Blueberries contain anthocyanin which gives them their dark blue hue and can help reduce inflammation. Lastly, turmeric is full of curcumin, an antioxidant that is anti-inflammatory.</p><p>In addition to food, there are other lifestyle changes that can help reduce inflammation. Exercise (especially moderate intensity aerobic exercise), reducing stress, and avoiding smoking and alcohol are all beneficial. It is recommended to speak with a physician or qualified nutritionist to determine which foods, lifestyle changes, and treatments will work best for you.</p><p>Overall, following an anti-inflammatory diet can be beneficial for those with psoriasis. Eating a nutrient-rich diet full of fruits, vegetables, and healthy sources of fats can help reduce inflammation and flare-ups. Additionally, exercising, reducing stress, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol can also help. It is important to speak with your physician or nutritionist to find the best ways to make lifestyle changes to help reduce inflammation and psoriasis symptoms.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/z7vln9r938o style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is Psoriasis?</p><p>A1: Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that causes red, scaly patches to appear on the skin.
