Eczema is a skin condition that can often be exasperating - but you don’t have to suffer in silence! An anti-inflammatory diet has been scientifically proven to provide relief and greatly improve the symptoms of eczema. Here are some tips for implementing an anti-inflammatory diet for eczema; a journey to healthier, more radiant skin.\nFirstly, cut out trigger foods that tend to cause inflammation. Common culprits include dairy products, processed foods, sugar, and foods high in saturated fats. Instead, stock your pantry with nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts, and whole grains.\nSecondly, don’t forget to stay hydrated! Consuming adequate amounts of water may reduce inflammation, and if you’re following an anti-inflammatory diet, it’ll help your body absorb the nutrients it needs. Drink anywhere from 1.2 to 2 liters of water each day.\nThirdly, aim to reduce stress. Stress can make eczema worse, so take measures to reduce its effect on your life. Exercise is one of the most effective ways to reduce stress, so try to get a few minutes of physical activity on a regular basis.\nFinally, remember that it’s essential to maintain patience and dedication to your anti-inflammatory diet. It might take some time for your skin to improve - however, if you stay consistent and follow these guidelines, you’ll likely see improvements over time. Don’t give up!\nIf you’re looking to improve the symptoms of eczema, why not give an anti-inflammatory diet a try? With dedication and patience, you can bring yourself one step closer to a healthier, more radiant complexion. Best of luck!\n“Recent studies have shown that an anti-inflammatory diet can reduce symptoms associated with eczema. Eating anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help reduce inflammation in the body and reduce eczema flare-ups.” (Shah, 2021)\n“A study published in the journal Pediatrics found that those who followed an anti-inflammatory diet had fewer eczema flare-ups and better symptom control than those who didn’t. The study also found that those who followed the diet for three months had significantly more improvement in their eczema symptoms” (Haill, 2020)\n“In order to effectively implement an anti-inflammatory diet to reduce eczema symptoms, it is important to limit processed, refined, and sugary foods, which can all trigger inflammation. Instead, focus on including minimally processed, nutrient-dense foods such as brightly-colored fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains.
